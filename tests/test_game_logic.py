# --- Regression tests for the high/low direction bug ---
# The bug: when a guess was too high, the hint said "Go HIGHER!" (and vice
# versa), sending the player the wrong way. The outcome label was correct, but
# the message pointed in the opposite direction. These tests pin the message to
# the correct direction.
